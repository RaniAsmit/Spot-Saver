# What problem it solves ?

In today's world, finding a parking space
has become a major challenge for drivers.
With the increasing number of vehicles on
the road, parking has become a scarce
commodity in most cities. To solve this
problem, we have come up with an app that
helps drivers find and provide parking
spaces.
Our app is designed to make parking easier
and more convenient for everyone. It
provides a platform where people can
share their parking spaces with others who
are in need of one.
